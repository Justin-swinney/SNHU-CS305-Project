**Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?**
-	Artemis Financial is a consulting company that creates individualized financial plans for their customers, such as savings, retirement, investments, and insurance plans. Artemis Financial are looking to modernize operations by using effective software security, they have a public web interface and they’re looking for advice to better protect their client’s data and sensitive information.
  
**What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?**

-	I feel I had gained a better understanding of what and when to suppress vulnerabilities that may not have a fix at the very moment, it is important to code securely as doing this poorly could be a direct result of leaked client information and potentially massive loss of profits to your company. A company that is known for its secure code is a trusted one therefore leading to more clientele and better reviews and high-quality products clients will use without worry. 

**What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?**

-	Overall, the vulnerability assessment was challenging to me as I found myself overwhelmed with information and homing in on the important data only was as struggle at first, the more exposer to vulnerabilities and understanding them will better assist my skill in the future. 

**How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?**

-	Following secure coding practices, including encryption, testing, and checking dependencies and or updating those dependencies if needed increased layers of security, I believe I would assess vulnerabilities using similar methods learned in this course such as running dependency reports, reviewing recommended solutions, and implementing these solutions while also consistently updating my code base as patches or depreciated methods emerge from updates.  

**How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?**

-	 I made sure to run a dependency checker report prior to refactoring the code to see what vulnerabilities lied in the base code before putting my hands on the software, although this is not a super effective way, I then refactor the code and compared the reports to ensure that no new vulnerabilities came up. I then ran a few manual tests, (I should have run unit testing instead) where I changed the code to ensure that strings that were very similar did not show up with similar results after going through the cipher. 

**What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?**

-	The use of testing tools such as dependency checker or internal tools like code coverage for test cases will help me greatly when producing projects, I am working on for fun such as a full stack web application where security is a must as user input will be taken in.

**Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?**

-	I believe I would show employers my understanding of algorithm ciphers and their purpose.
